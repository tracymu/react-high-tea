This project will be a React front end to interface for my old Rails app [High Tea Around The World](http://www.tracecode.com.au/blog/another-project-my-high-tea-app/), which I built back in 2013 as one of my first Rails projects. 

I am still using this app to record high teas, and decided to give it a facelift while learning React.

Run locally with 
`webpack-dev-server ./src/app.js --hot --inline`
